## Snapshot
I build structured, reliable data workflows that power analytics and ML-ready datasets. My work focuses on **data quality, automation, and decision-ready reporting**—with an engineering mindset around **maintainability, observability, and reproducibility**.

**Current focus:** scaling my portfolio with end-to-end case studies (**SQL → Python → Tableau**) while maintaining consistent proof-of-work through interview-grade SQL practice.

## Featured Work
### SQL Interview Practice — DataLemur (100+ Solutions)
**Repo:** (https://github.com/ShayanYawarBhatti/sql-datalemur-archive.git)

**What this demonstrates**
- Core analytics SQL: **joins, CTEs, aggregations, window functions, subqueries**
- Pattern mastery: top-N per group, rolling metrics, cohort/retention patterns, ranking, weighted averages
- Clean conventions: consistent formatting, clear assumptions, readable structure

**How to review (recruiter-friendly)**
- Start with: `README.md` → then browse by topic folders (joins / windows / ctes / aggregations)
- Each solution is written to be readable + debuggable

> Next milestone: publish 2–3 end-to-end portfolio projects with datasets + dashboards + writeups.
